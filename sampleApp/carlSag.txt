FROM THIS DISTANT VANTAGE POINT, THE EARTH MIGHT NOT SEEM OF ANY PARTICULAR INTEREST.
BUT FOR US, IT'S DIFFERENT. CONSIDER AGAIN THAT DOT. THAT'S HERE. THAT'S HOME. THAT'S US.
ON IT EVERYONE YOU LOVE, EVERYONE YOU KNOW, EVERYONE YOU EVER HEARD OF, EVERY HUMAN BEING 
WHO EVER WAS, LIVED OUT THEIR LIVES.
THE AGGREGATE OF OUR JOY AND SUFFERING, THOUSANDS OF CONFIDENT RELIGIONS, IDEOLOGIES, AND 
ECONOMIC DOCTRINES, EVERY HUNTER AND FORAGER, EVERY HERO AND COWARD, EVERY CREATOR AND 
DESTROYER OF CIVILIZATION, EVERY KING AND PEASANT, EVERY YOUNG COUPLE IN LOVE, EVERY
MOTHER AND FATHER, HOPEFUL CHILD, INVENTOR AND EXPLORER, EVERY TEACHER OF MORALS, EVERY 
CORRUPT POLITICIAN, EVERY 'SUPERSTAR,' EVERY 'SUPREME LEADER,' EVERY SAINT AND SINNER IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR SPECIES LIVED THERE – ON A MOTE OF DUST SUSPENDED IN A SUNBEAM.
THE EARTH IS A VERY SMALL STAGE IN A VAST COSMIC ARENA. THINK OF THE RIVERS OF BLOOD SPILLED 
BY ALL THOSE GENERALS AND EMPERORS SO THAT IN GLORY AND TRIUMPH THEY COULD BECOME THE MOMENTARY 
MASTERS OF A FRACTION OF A DOT. THINK OF THE ENDLESS CRUELTIES VISITED BY THE INHABITANTS OF ONE 
CORNER OF THIS PIXEL ON THE SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE INHABITANTS OF SOME OTHER CORNER.
HOW FREQUENT THEIR MISUNDERSTANDINGS, HOW EAGER THEY ARE TO KILL ONE ANOTHER, HOW FERVENT THEIR 
HATREDS. OUR POSTURINGS, OUR IMAGINED SELF-IMPORTANCE, THE DELUSION THAT WE HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED 
POSITION IN THE UNIVERSE, ARE CHALLENGED BY THIS POINT OF PALE LIGHT.
OUR PLANET IS A LONELY SPECK IN THE GREAT ENVELOPING COSMIC DARK. IN OUR OBSCURITY – IN ALL THIS 
VASTNESS – THERE IS NO HINT THAT HELP WILL COME FROM ELSEWHERE TO SAVE US FROM OURSELVES.
THE EARTH IS THE ONLY WORLD KNOWN, SO FAR, TO HARBOR LIFE. THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE, AT LEAST IN THE 
NEAR FUTURE, TO WHICH OUR SPECIES COULD MIGRATE. VISIT, YES. SETTLE, NOT YET. LIKE IT OR NOT, 
FOR THE MOMENT, THE EARTH IS WHERE WE MAKE OUR STAND. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT ASTRONOMY IS A HUMBLING AND 
CHARACTER-BUILDING EXPERIENCE. THERE IS PERHAPS NO BETTER DEMONSTRATION OF THE FOLLY OF HUMAN CONCEITS 
THAN THIS DISTANT IMAGE OF OUR TINY WORLD.
TO ME, IT UNDERSCORES OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL MORE KINDLY WITH ONE ANOTHER AND TO PRESERVE AND CHERISH 
THE PALE BLUE DOT, THE ONLY HOME WE'VE EVER KNOWN."
